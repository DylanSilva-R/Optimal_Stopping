## Optimal Stopping Theory
### This small project was all about proving the theory to myself.

### Downloading and how to run.
- First, download all the python files from your specified scenario.
- Second, download python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Run the main.py scripts.

#### Disclaimer, the parking problem python files still need to worked on.
#### I will be adding more scenarios and GUI's soon.
